You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

### So... what’s going on here?

Just a curious student on a mildly chaotic journey through the wonderful world of **cybersecurity**.

Expect to find a glorious mess of:
- CTF writeups (because hacking legally is a vibe)
- Random ramblings about cool tech things that catch my eye
- Possibly rants powered by caffeine and late-night debugging

**Why am I doing this?**  
Simple. Immortality.  
Okay—not really. I just want to leave a trace of my existence on the internet before I vanish back under my rock. Consider this my digital graffiti.

> “I was here.” – Me, probably.

If you’re reading this, scroll down. You might just find a way to connect (or not, depends on how extroverted I’m feeling this week).

Alright, that’s enough socializing for today. *Retreating into the shadows...*

Peace ✌️  
\- Your friendly neighborhood introvert

### So... what’s going on here?

Just a curious student on a mildly chaotic journey through the wonderful world of **cybersecurity**.

Expect to find a glorious mess of:
- CTF writeups (because hacking legally is a vibe)
- Random ramblings about cool tech things that catch my eye
- Possibly rants powered by caffeine and late-night debugging

**Why am I doing this?**  
Simple. Immortality.  
Okay—not really. I just want to leave a trace of my existence on the internet before I vanish back under my rock. Consider this my digital graffiti.

> “I was here.” – Me, probably.

If you’re reading this, scroll down. You might just find a way to connect (or not, depends on how extroverted I’m feeling this week).

Alright, that’s enough socializing for today. *Retreating into the shadows...*

Peace ✌️  
\- Your friendly neighborhood introvert
